This C# Windows Forms application allows users to load an image, specify a downscaling percentage, and produce a new downscaled image. The program features three buttons.The first one loads a picture, the next two are for downscaling: one that performs the operation in the consequential way and another that uses a separate thread for improved responsiveness. The program includes a custom image resizing algorithm. It measures and displays the time taken for both non-threaded and threaded resizing operations.

Code Explanation: First we create form and add buttons and labels. We have three buttons, the first one is for adding a file. The next two are for consequential downscaling and one with threads. Each button represents a method in which we implement the corresponding action. The algorithm is not entirely mine, I have helped myself with other sources(I'm a beginner though). The design of the program is very simple with the emphasis being on the code itself.
